# Function-Image

C++ combined with Easyx to draw function images

## 1.0[C++]

(Author: [LightByteCodes] (https://github.com/LightByteCodes))
This program is suitable for image drawing of quadratic functions, primary functions, inverse proportional functions

Two small black windows will pop up when using,
Enter from the small black window on the command line, and press any key to close after entering everything.

Then look at the small black window (it's so inconvenient)

Currently only for one-time use (close when finished)

A gray dot represents 1

## 2.0[C++]

(Author: [clear-sea](https://github.com/clear-sea))

For quadratic functions, primary functions, inverse proportional functions for image drawing, the code for core functions (drawing function images) directly follows the original author of the previous version

New features:

+ Multiple draw function
+ Clear the canvas
+ Resize the window

(Note: The current oldMain .cpp is the source code for this version.)

## 2.1
(Author: [clear-sea](https://github.com/clear-sea))

This time, the command line window was abandoned, all replaced by EasyX's graphical interface, and the input was implemented using EasyX's InputBox, and other aspects of the function did not change much, but this time all the core code was written by myself

Because it hasn't changed much, the version number hasn't changed much.
