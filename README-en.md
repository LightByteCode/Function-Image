# Function-Image

C++ combined with Easyx to draw function images

## Legacy version

This program is suitable for image drawing of quadratic functions, primary functions, inverse proportional functions

Two small black windows will pop up when using,
Enter from the small black window on the command line, and press any key to close after entering everything.

Then look at the small black window (it's so inconvenient)

Currently only for one-time use (close when finished)

A gray dot represents 1
